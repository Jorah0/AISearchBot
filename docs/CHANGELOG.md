# Changelog (development passes, newest first)

## Pass 12 (2026-11-05): profile bank, LinkedIn import, design-review fixes

- Profile bank (`lodestar/profile.py`): every imported resume is kept; contact, skills, spoken languages, roles,
  education, certifications and projects are pooled in `profile.json` with their sources. AI extraction with an
  offline parser fallback. LinkedIn: profile URL, "Download your data" zip (profile CSVs only), "Save to PDF".
  `lodestar profile ...`, Profile bank panel, doctor line, autofill falls back to bank contact details.
- Prompts read `candidate_text()`: the master plus bank facts it omits, fitted by whole sections. The old
  `profile_text()[:N]` cut the Preferences section out of ranking and reply prompts. A template master never reaches
  a prompt (the bank stands in, or the feature stops with a clear message).
- Design review (6 dimensions, 42 confirmed findings, about 20 distinct) and fixes: the monitor loop no longer dies
  silently on SystemExit from the AI layer (per-step guards, `last_error` in the top bar, `running` reset); IMAP and
  SMTP verify TLS certificates; a cross-process lock stops duplicate mail scans; unauthenticated senders no longer
  become a job's contact; watch listings are marked seen only after judgement and manual searches mark nothing;
  truncated AI replies raise instead of being saved; a self-healed model is remembered only after it answers;
  settings.json writes are atomic and locked; profile.md writes are snapshotted; regenerated job documents keep the
  previous version; backups snapshot SQLite with the online backup API; the capture token persists across restarts;
  the page cannot be framed; the public autofill route no longer returns the answer bank; search-result XSS fixed;
  inbox draft edits survive the refresh; drafted answers show on the Answers tab; council chat keeps the coach
  context; merge uses the editor text; the .docx is regenerated when an edited document is saved; follow-up cadence
  counts nudges once and proposes the ghosted close-out once; the AI client retries network errors and timeouts.
- Not fixed yet: email-to-job matching by company name only, DKIM trust for free-mail domains, private preferences
  living inside the resume file, inbox items stuck in "running" after a crash, schema migration race between threads.

## Pass. Verified state (2026-11-04, seventh pass: coverage and analytics)

- Three more keyless job sources (Hacker News Who is hiring via Algolia, Jobicy, The Muse), URL de-duplication on
  add/capture, a conversion funnel with median days per stage and outcomes by source (`jobs funnel`, Board header),
  interview reminders 48 hours ahead from the calendar files, application packet zips, pay figures extracted from
  postings into the gap check, per-ATS autofill selectors. 34 tests.

## Passa. Verified state (2026-11-04, sixth pass: hardening)

- 26 offline tests pass. Fixed: cross-origin access to the local API (per-launch token, CORS only on the two
  bookmarklet routes), lost mail on classification failure, substring company matches, scheduler command that
  depended on `VIRTUAL_ENV`, deprecated UTC calls. Added: rotating log file, task-table pruning, stale Obsidian notes
  removed, chunked ranking, council allowlist and default-provider preference, token usage accounting, model
  discovery with a clear wrong-model error, ATS-aware autofill matching, backup and export commands with a nightly
  backup tool, accessibility attributes and focus handling, mock interview and dictation in the UI, local-only
  preset, version 0.2.0, CI workflow, unix installer.
- Verified live: 403 without token, 200 with token, CSRF-style approve blocked, bookmarklet routes still work
  cross-origin, no CORS headers on private routes.

## Passa. Verified state (2026-11-03, fifth pass: Lodestar rename + UI overhaul)

- Full rename: package and CLI `lodestar` (`jobbot` kept as an alias), data in `~/.lodestar` (an existing `~/.jobbot`
  is copied over on first run), `LODESTAR_*` env vars (`JOBBOT_HOME` still honoured), keyring service `lodestar`
  (old secrets are read and copied transparently), scheduled task and shortcuts renamed, docs and tests rewritten.
- UI overhaul: sidebar navigation with inbox badge, top bar with stats and quick actions, status-coloured board,
  right-hand job drawer with grouped actions (Documents / Communicate / Schedule and decide / Admin), inline offer
  form, loading states on every AI button, empty states, toasts with severity, Esc to close, responsive under 900px.
  Markup, styles and script split into `index.html`, `app.css`, `app.js`; one `/static/<file>` route with a
  traversal guard. Verified: JS syntax, all routes, 18 tests.
- Still not exercised with real credentials: live AI calls and SMTP sending.

## Passa. Verified state (2026-11-03, fourth pass: idea crafting + lifecycle gaps)

- 18 offline tests pass. New: idea-crafting engine (`ideas.py`: diverge across providers or one provider plus a
  critic pass, converge, score impact x fit / effort, refine with history, status tracking) with ten preset topics;
  company research pack; autofill-not-submit bookmarklet (`/api/autofill`); docx template hook; `lodestar features`
  self-generating inventory (`docs/FEATURES.md`); Ideas tab in the UI.
- Verified live: autofill data route, ideas status and delete endpoints, craft error path without a provider.

## Passa. Verified state (2026-11-03, third pass: automation with approvals)

- 16 offline tests pass. New in this pass: per-tool switches (`settings.py`), the approvals inbox with the only
  executors that send mail / move status / add jobs (`approvals.py`), reply drafting for confirmations, assessments,
  interview invites (slot acceptance from your availability, .ics on send) and offers (never accepts or names a number),
  recruiter contact capture, follow-up and thank-you drafts, answer bank + form-question answering, per-job checklist,
  offer evaluation, AI triage of new listings, Inbox / Tools / Answers tabs in the UI, `docs/AUTOMATION.md`.
- Verified live through the UI: tool toggles, preferences, answer bank, checklist task, propose -> inbox -> approve.
- Verified offline with a faked model: an interview email from a human sender captures the contact, leaves the status
  untouched while `email_classify` is manual, and queues one `set_status` and one `send_email` proposal carrying the
  chosen slot and In-Reply-To; a no-reply sender gets neither contact nor reply.
- Still not exercised with real credentials: live AI calls and SMTP sending.

## Passb. Verified state (2026-11-03, second pass)

- 12 offline tests pass. Added since the first pass: browser capture endpoint with CORS and title splitting,
  resume-variant hashing + `lodestar variants`, interview `.ics` files (auto-created from interview mail with a date),
  outreach drafts, weekly digest, Obsidian mirror of the tracker (`lodestar export obsidian`), scheduled-task installer,
  `lodestar app` (loop + UI in one process), one-click `start.bat` / `start.sh`, and `install.bat` / `uninstall.ps1`.
- Installer verified on this machine: `.venv` created, `.env` created, Desktop + Start Menu shortcuts written,
  `lodestar.exe app` launches. The scheduled task and standalone exe are opt-in flags and were not exercised.
- Earlier verified state:

- 9 offline tests pass (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`).
- Live checks passed: job search against the three APIs, page watch baseline and no-change cycle, every UI endpoint
  (add, status, note, detail, background search task, clean no-key error, watches, delete).
- Not yet exercised with real credentials: AI calls (no provider key stored yet) and IMAP (no mail creds stored yet).
  Both paths are covered by request-shape tests with a faked HTTP layer.
